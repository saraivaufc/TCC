With the increase of technological resources in the classroom, arose the need of creating 
of new teaching methodologies. In this perspective, the aim of this work was 
develop an information system to assist in the teaching and learning of mathematics 
for students of basic level medium and higher who seek a complement to the current method of teaching. 
To this end, we develop a study of the technological nature of character exploration. 
The information system implemented was based on design patterns and technologies 
directed to the Internet. As a result of this work, we have obtained a Virtual Environment 
Learning by teaching methodology to resolution of problems, enables students to study math inside and outside of the classroom so self-rhythmic, while still allowing teachers to track the progress in learning of their students and intervene as they face difficulties in learning.
