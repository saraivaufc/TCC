With the increase of technological resources in the classroom, the need arose for the creation of new teaching methodologies. In this line, the objective of the present work was to develop a teaching platform to help students of middle and higher levels in their teaching and learning of mathematics. For this, the developed platform uses problem-solving teaching methodology to enable students to study mathematics in and out of the classroom and at their own pace, while still allowing teachers to monitor progress in their students' learning and Intervene when they face difficulties during their learning.
